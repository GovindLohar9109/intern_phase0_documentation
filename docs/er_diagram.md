# Entity–Relationship (E-R) Diagram

## Overview

The **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** represents the logical structure of the ELMS database.  
It defines the entities, their attributes, and the relationships among them to ensure **data integrity**, **consistency**, and **efficient querying**.

This design supports features such as:
- User authentication and role-based access
- Course enrollment and tracking

| `password` | varchar | - | Encrypted user password |
| `created_at` | timestamp | - | Account creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | - | Last update timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | timestamp | - | Soft delete indicator |

---

### **Roles**
| Field | Type | Key | Description |
|--------|------|-----|-------------|
| `id` | int | PK | Unique role identifier |
| `name` | varchar | - | Role name (`Admin`, `User`) |
| `created_at` | timestamp | - | Role creation time |

### **User_Roles**
| Field | Type | Key | Description |
|--------|------|-----|-------------|
