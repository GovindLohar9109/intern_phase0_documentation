# **Business Use Case**

## **Problem**

In today’s fast-paced digital learning environment, many learners prefer to study independently and at their own pace.  
However, they face several challenges when relying solely on online resources:

- **Unstructured Learning:** Many websites or platforms provide scattered or incomplete information, making it difficult to follow a structured learning path.


- **No Personalized Space:** Most free resources do not allow learners to track their progress or organize their learning journey.

These limitations make self-learning time-consuming and sometimes discouraging, especially for beginners who seek step-by-step, beginner-friendly explanations.
